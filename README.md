## Visualizations of NYC Bikeshare Data Using Tableau
### Background
I created visulaizations using data collected from the NYC Citibike program (https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data). I downloaded data from 2019. They provided monthly files in csv form. I combined the 12 months into one csv file to use for data in Tableau. The link to my Tableau page can be found here:

### Observations:
* Male riders outnumbered female riders by 3 to 1 in 2019.
* When looking at peak rider hours rush hour in the monring and evening seemed to be the most popular time to use CitiBike.
*Unsurprisingly, winter months (October through March) saw a dramatic reduction in ridership.
* Weekend ridership was lower than weekdays.
